    <p>
        It is possible to override/rewrite the 'Trust all certificate'-setting for each Job separately.
        Setting this checkbox to 'true' will result in accepting all certificates for the given Job.

    If your remote Jenkins host has a
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-signed_certificate" target="_blank">
        self-signed certificate
    </a>
    or its certificate is not trusted, you may want to enable this option.
    It will accept untrusted certificates for the given host.

    <p><strong>This is unsafe and should only be used for testing or if you trust the host.</strong></p>
